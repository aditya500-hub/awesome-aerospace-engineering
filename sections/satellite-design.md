# Satellite Design

## Overview
Curated resources for designing small satellites (CubeSats/SmallSats) and spacecraft subsystems. Includes books, open-source tools, datasets, standards, and tutorials for mission design, ADCS, power, thermal, and mechanical design.

## Books
- *Spacecraft Systems Engineering* — Peter Fortescue, John Stark, Graham Swinerd. [Book]
- *Small Satellite Design Handbook* — (Add link to an accessible handbook or chapter) [Book]

## Standards & Specs
- [CubeSat Design Specification (CubeSat.org)](https://www.cubesat.org) — Official CubeSat standards, mechanical/interface guidelines. [Standard]
- [Consult the CubeSat resources on CubeSat.org](https://www.cubesat.org/resources) — Hardware and electrical bus guidance. [Standard]

## Tools & Simulators (Open / Freely accessible)
- [GMAT (General Mission Analysis Tool)](https://github.com/GMAT/GMAT) — NASA-supported mission analysis and trajectory tool. [Software]
- [OpenMDAO (Open-source MDO framework)](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO) — Good for trade-space studies and system-level optimization. [Software]
- [OpenVSP (Vehicle Sketch Pad)](https://github.com/OpenVSP/OpenVSP) — Parametric geometry & CFD pre-processing for aircraft/space vehicles. [Software]

## Datasets & Repositories
- [NASA Open Data](https://data.nasa.gov) — Portal for many space datasets (telemetry, remote sensing). [Dataset]
- [Zenodo (search for satellite telemetry datasets)](https://zenodo.org) — Community-hosted datasets for research. [Dataset]

## Courses & Tutorials
- (Add curated online courses / MOOC links here — e.g., small-sat design or systems engineering lectures.) [Course]

## Papers & References
- (Add open-access and arXiv papers relevant to satellite design and subsystem trade studies. e.g., “CubeSat design” arXiv search results.) [Paper]
